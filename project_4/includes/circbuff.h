 *      Description:  This header file contains the functions for circular buffer
 *
 *      Author: Arundhathi Swami and Vignesh Jayaram
 *      Date: November 7,2016
 *
 *      1. struct cirbuff_t
 *      > This structure contains members of the circular buffer
 *
 *      2. enum states
 *      > Enum contains the various states the buffer can exist in
 *
 *      3. Buffer_Full
 *      > function to check if the buffer is full to its capacity
 *
 *      4. Buffer_Empty
 *      > function to check if buffer has no elements in it
 *
 *      5. add_item
 *      > This function first checks if buffer is full.
 *      > If buffer is full ,then function returns 1.
 *		> If there is space in buffer, item is added to the buffer.
 *		> The function also checks for wrapping functionality.
 *		> Function returns SUCCESS i.e 3 if item is successfully added.
 *
 *		6. remove_item
 *		> This function first checks if buffer is empty.
 *      > If buffer is empty ,then function returns 2.
 *		> If there are elements in buffer, item is removed from the buffer.
 *		> The function also checks for wrapping functionality.
 *		> Function returns SUCCESS if item is successfully removed.
 *
 *		7. Buffer_Init
 *		> This function dynamically allocates space for the buffer on heap.
 *
 *		8. Buffer_Flush
 *		> This function uses remove_item function to completely empty the buffer.
 *
 *		9. Buffer_fill
 *		> This function uses add_item function to fill the buffer completely.
 *
 *		10. Buffer_free
 *		> This function is used to destroy the memory allocated for buffer.
